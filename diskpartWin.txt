How to make a partition Active using a Windows installation CD/DVD

    Bootup from any full Windows 7 or Vista installation DVD or even from NeoSmart's free Windows 7 System Recovery Disk or Vista Recovery Disk. All four perform identically in this situation. A Restore/Repair CD from an OEM is not sufficient.
    It must be a 64-bit version if a 64-bit Windows is installed.
    Select Repair your computer at the Install now screen.
    Click No if asked to Repair and Restart.
    Click Cancel if it looks for a Disk Image.
    Now in System Recovery Options,
    click the Command Prompt option.
    Press ENTER after you type in each of these commands which are not case-sensitive:
        DISKPART     (to open the partition utility)
        LIST DISK     (disk number(s) will be shown)
        SELECT DISK n     (where n is the number of the disk - probably 0)
        LIST PARTITION     (partition number(s) will be shown)
        SELECT PARTITION n     (where n is the number of the Primary partition you wish to make Active)
        ACTIVE     (the selected partition on the selected disk will be made Active)
        EXIT     (to exit DiskPart)
        EXIT     (to exit the Command Prompt) 
    Restart computer.
